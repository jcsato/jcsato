Battle Brothers enthusiast. I make mods for the game, for example:

- [Of Flesh and Faith Plus+](https://github.com/jcsato/of_flesh_and_faith_plus) - new origins
- [Equipment Variants](https://github.com/jcsato/sato_equipment_variants_mod) - new cosmetics
- [Additional Equipment](https://github.com/jcsato/sato_additional_equipment_mod) - new armor and helmets
- [Established Company](https://github.com/jcsato/sato_established_company_mod) - new random start origin
